In ancient times, some believed earthquakes were triggered by winds trapped in subterranean caves. As pressure built underground, the air above would become hot and calm. These caves would occasionally gasp, their trapped air rushing out, shaking the earth.  The resulting believe in earthquake weather, that certain weather conditions would predict a coming earthquake, was particularly held true in California mining culture.

Onsen's debut album Earthquake Weather was written of the course of two years of intense change: a career in international policy to the life of a musician, the ends, beginnings, and reexaminations of relationships and sexuality, a new home in Los Angeles. With a sound blurring electronic elements, live instrumentation, and vocal harmonies, the songs on Earthquake Weather mark a passing from one kind of life to another. Started as the solo project of Drew Straus, Onsen has become a collaboration spanning both coasts.
