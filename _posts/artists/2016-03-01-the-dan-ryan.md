The Dan Ryan stretches eleven miles through the south side of Chicago. A clogged artery, the expressway slowly churns its commuters from the city’s heart to the ghettos, outskirts, and suburbs out beyond Northwest Indiana. Trains shuffle through its enormous median to 95thStreet. Great iron edifices deliver passengers east and westbound, roaring seventy feet above the freeway’s concrete floor.

Tucked in the city’s southwest corner lays a patch of forest bearing the same name. Carved by glaciers, The Dan Ryan Woods boast Chicago’s highest vantage point. Climb its light towers to admire her big, broad, shimmering shoulders. Linger under its giant maples to escape the whirr of the city streets. The Dan Ryan represents the imminent collision between tranquility and transition; an acknowledgement that regardless of ones stature, seat, or disposition, you’re still along for the ride.

Formed in 2011 as a side project in Lawrence, KS, The Dan Ryan now resides in Austin, TX, where the debut LP was home-recorded between December 2013 to July 2014. Psychedelic and deeply personal, these songs bear a chapter of change and evoke the fleeting nature of one’s perspective on life.
