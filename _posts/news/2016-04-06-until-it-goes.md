It’s always a fascinating experience to listen to original material coming from prolific producers. The juxtaposition of the roles that comes from shifting gears between producing and creating music really provides for an insightful listening journey. At the first impression, the video for John Congleton and the Nighty Nite’s ‘’Until It Goes’’ comes off as a horror ridden tale and we created a video that opens up a door to how that demon in the ridden can come in different forms. The story sneaking through the grotesque imagery is of a former Nazi officer in the final phase of his life. Old and lacking power, the officer is visited by the angel of death, arguably a bigger evil than the officer himself, who goes on to deprive the officer of his being; both by sucking the life out of him and literally slicing his face off. Through some dark magic; the soul, the flesh and the blood of one gives life to another in beautiful form.
