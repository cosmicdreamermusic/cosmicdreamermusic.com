Cosmic Dreamer has had the fortune of working at the small compound that is Tiny Telephone Studios in San Fransisco, both with Onsen’s initial tracking for his upcoming Earthquake Weather and for the mixing of Allelujah’s The Death and Life of Capt Nathan Baker. Run by the one and only John Vanderslice whose keen ear for vintage sounds has helped him to create an unparalleled catalog of analog instruments and recording gear. The art of tape op is one of the many skills honed at the studios there. Recording and mixing to tape is a standard and the only way John will work if you have the pleasure of spending a few days with him and his magic. Vanderslice has such an obsession with buying vintage mics, compressors and tape machines that he has expanded into a second studio located on the other side of the bridge in Oakland. Home to a beautifully rebuilt Neve board in a room adorned with zebra wood flooring and his signature reclaimed painted wood walls, a great live room which has been perfectly tuned, and enough analog gear to make your head pop, the C room in Oakland is sure to become the new destination of anyone hoping to get a taste of his Shaman-like touch.
