Shot in the depths of Casa Byers-Bright, this video features Jordan Geiger; whom we know as Hospital Ships, performing a stripped down and barebones version of Long May You from his upcoming 4th album The Past is Not a Flood. Although the album is beautifully produced by the impeccable John Congleton, this acoustic version of Long May You offers an insight into the emotional core of Geiger’s work on The Past is Not a Flood that he defines as ‘’a product of his dealing with trying to break the cycle of mental illness, anxiety, and depression. ‘’ With the increasingly intimate nature of Long May You pouring out of the song as it progresses, Geiger’s statement of the song being about ‘’accepting the painful and temporary nature of life” feels all the more resonant. A simple and resonant video for an artist with an intimate and powerful message.
