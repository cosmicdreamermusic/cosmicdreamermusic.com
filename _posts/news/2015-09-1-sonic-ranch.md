Watch as Allelujah works through a harmony at the beautiful and all together magical Sonic Ranch Studios in Tornillo, Texas, the largest residential recording studio in the world. Surrounded by pecan trees as far as the eye can see and the Mexican border just beyond that, it provides the feeling of being no where at all. This kind of immense separation from urban life creates a setting that allows musicians to create music on a different platform. It floats somewhere between the endless skies in Western Texas and the ethereal heavens of the recording gods.

From the outside, the studio building is nothing more than a old adobe barn surrounded by a few other dilapidated structures that could be blown over with a strong wind. Upon entering though you are greeted by patterned rugs, beautiful wood beams, a vintage Neve board with flying faders and a studio built to match any musician’s dreams. They put you up, feed you breakfast and lunch and even do your laundry!  Spending some quality time with the studio’s eccentric owner, Tony Rancich, is worth the price of admission alone.
