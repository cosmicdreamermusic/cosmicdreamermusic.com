Check out the new Des Ark Video we created for them in on our [productions page](/productions/) or on [NPR’s First Watch](http://www.npr.org/event/music/450852364/first-watch-des-ark-snake-stuff).

Snake Stuff was filmed over two days in the lovely and inviting rural Durham, North Carolina. Surrounded by lush forests and an eerie set of ponds, Des Ark’s home created the perfect setting to tell the story of one woman’s daily routine that unknowingly created a dancing spirit who has rituals of it’s own to perform deep inside the woods.
